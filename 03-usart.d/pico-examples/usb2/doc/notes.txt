remnant doco from usart version.  Ignore.

Pinout and wiring

The three upper left pins of the RP2040 Pico board are
leveraged for the USART.

Ground is the third pin.

The 'TX' pin of the Raspberry Pi pin header goes to the
pin on the end of the board, in the corner, not far from
the ground just mentioned.

The 'RX' pin of the Raspberry Pi pin header goes to the
middle pin of these three pins on the Pico.

So, a shared ground, and a TX/RX pair - that's the entire
wiring, save for however the conversation is to be monitored
(in this case on the Raspberry Pi).



CP2104 USB to USART Bridge - connections

In fact, no Raspberry Pi was ever used - instead, a PiUART
(from Adafruit) was substituted - same pinout (and a bit of
a ruse to describe it first as the Raspberry Pi).

PiUART is CP2104 in a convenient carrier form factor, to mate
with the main header pins of a Raspberry Pi.

The PiUART (like the Raspberry Pi) has five pins in the
corner: +5 +5 GND TX RX

The +5 pins are ignored (left disconnected).  Only the
last three are used (GND TX RX).

On the Pico side, the colors are (from the corner):

    Orange Brown Black

Only Black makes real sense here, as it is for Ground.
Orange and Brown were simply convenient to use, for this
one-off.

On the PiUART side, it's:

    Black Orange Brown.

So,   on one end,   Orange and Black  bracket  Brown.
On the other end,   Brown  and Black  bracket  Orange.

'Bracket' here just means that's the middle wire/pin. ;)

More simply:

    Orange in the middle on one end; and

    Brown in the middle on the other end

of the 6" jumper (Dupont style).

Ground is black and forced as to position.  It's obvious.

Program only does an output character stream, at the moment;
provision for reading characters (from the keyboard) is not
yet implemented, though planned.
